Our place in the universe is incredibly unpriviledged and mundane (at least according to Copernicus). Though the Copernican Principle is a widely accepted phenomenon, the true scale of its physical manifestation is, at least to me, widely underappreciated by most. Ergo, what better way to appreciate the wonders of astrophysics and cosmology than an interactive visualizer of just how small we truly are! Also, wouldn't it be cool if this app could double as a way to gain a sense for the differences in elements like orbital period, radial dimensions, and much more within the planets of our the solar system? You're in luck. Enjoy! :).
